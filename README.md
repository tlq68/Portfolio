# Portfolio

This Portfolio is meant to outline some of my achievements as a webdeveloper. I come from a teaching background, but I have a passion for learning new things and I am driven by my desire to combine teaching and technology. This webpage will demonstrate some of my technical skills, but I emplore you to reach out to learn what else I can do. [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/trevor-lister)

## Initial Setup

I first set up the code using VS Code's standard boilerplate and added the links to Bootstrap's CSS and JavaScript CDNs as well as my own CSS/JS files. I then set up the skeleton layout with the different sections I wanted to use and filled them with placeholder text. I then chose a color scheme for the file.

## Building the Navbar

After creating the starging skeleton, I used a Bootstrap Navbar boilerplate and adjusted it to my preferences. I thought about using the dropdown to allow the user to change the style of the webpage and show off different themes, but thought it was better to have a functioning portfolio before diving deep into styles.

## Welcome Section

The height was set to the viewport and the content was centered. Later, the plan is to replace this section with a jumbotron-like feature.

## Projects Section

The height was set to the viewport and part of the content was centered. I added a spotlight section to be the centerpiece of the portfolio. 

The individual project tiles were aligned and given larger dimensions using Bootstrap.

## Footer Section

I increased the footer size to make it more visible. Then I added social buttons for people to reach out and collaborate with me.
